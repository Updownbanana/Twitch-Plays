# The Big Ol' Twitch Plays Repo

This was originally just for twitch plays FTL, but it now contains a couple of different programs that take commands from twitch chat and convert them to key presses and mouse clicks. 

The original code for this project was obtained directly from [this online tutorial](https://www.wituz.com/make-your-own-twitch-plays-stream.html) years ago, which in turn credits the code to Github user aidraj who does not appear to exist anymore. This formed the basis for the Keypresser class, the Twitch class, and the twitch_interpret method in the Interpreter class.

If you want to use any of these programs, check the [quickstart guide](https://github.com/Updownbanana/Twitch-Plays-FTL/wiki/Quickstart-Guide) on the wiki, and read the other wiki pages for info on specific programs. Documentation on python classes etc coming soon.
